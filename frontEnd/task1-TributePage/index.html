			<h3>Here's a time line of Kobe's career:</h3>
			<ul>
				<li><span class="period">NBA draft(1996)</span> - The first guard to ever be taken out of high school, Bryant was chosen as the 13th overall draft pick by the Charlotte Hornets in 1996.</li>
				<li><span class="period">Adjusting to the NBA (1996–1999)</span> - Bryant debuted in the Summer Pro League in Long Beach, California, scoring 25 points in front of a standing-room-only crowd. Defenders struggled to get in front of him, and his performance excited West and Lakers coach Del Harris.</li>
				<li><span class="period">Three-peat (1999–2002)</span> - After years of steady improvement, Bryant became one of the premier shooting guards in the league, earning appearances in the league's All-NBA, All-Star, and All-Defensive teams.</li>
				<li><span class="period">Coming up short (2002–2004)</span> - In the 2002–03 season, Bryant set an NBA record for three-pointers on January 7, 2003, making 12 against the Seattle SuperSonics. </li>
				<li><span class="period">Scoring records and playoff upsets (2004–2007)</span> - Bryant was closely scrutinized and criticized during the 2004–05 season with his reputation badly damaged from all that had happened over the previous year. </li>
				<li><span class="period">Back on top (2007–2010)</span> - Bryant won his fifth championship and earned his second consecutive NBA Finals MVP award. This marked the first time the Lakers won a Game 7 against the Boston Celtics in the NBA Finals. Bryant said that this was the most satisfying of all of his five championships.</li>
				<li><span class="period">Chasing a sixth championship (2010–2013)</span> - Bryant wanted a sixth championship to match Jordan's total. The Lakers started the 2010–11 season by winning their first eight games.</li>
				<li><span class="period">Injury-plagued years (2013–2015)</span> - Bryant resumed practicing starting in November, after the start of the 2013–14 season.</li>
				<li><span class="period">Final season (2015–2016)</span> - fter recovering to play in the 2015–16 preseason, Bryant suffered a calf injury and missed the final two weeks of exhibition games.</li>
